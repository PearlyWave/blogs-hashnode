I am learning Python. Here is a record for what I have learned recently. I'm a newbie and there may be something wrong.

# How I learn

I want to know what are learned while we are learning a stack or a language. Those notes are from the [textbook](http://www.saasbook.info/about) Ch2 preface and Ch2.1 of UC Berkeley's CS 169.
## Relation between stacks, languages, and frameworks

- Stack is any set of technologies including languages, frameworks and subsystems. 

- Frameworks are major parts. 

- People learn a language to use a certain framework in some stack. 


## Questions when learning a language


I need to fill the table below to get a basic knowledge about a language.

|Question|Type of Answer|Hint|
|-|-|-|
|Language type|Choose|Procedural/Object-oriented/Functional|
|Basic OO and encapsulation mechanisms|Text|Classes, interitance, composition, etc.|
|Basic imperative mechanis|Text|Variables, naming conventions, control flows, etc.|
|Complexity management|Text| namespacing, libraies, library and package management|
|Idioms of it|Text|Such as mix-in(duck typing) and blocks(annoymous lambdas) in Ruby|

Some useful knowledge:
1. Basic operations on collections just like in functional programming languages
2. Regular expressions, abbrexiated for regexps or regexes.

I gonna take the course *Python for everybody* on Coursera.
